          <p className="pd_ans">
            The Information and Communication revolution has brought enormous changes in the way we organize our lives, our economies, industries and institutions. These spectacular developments in modern times have undoubtedly enhanced the quality of our lives, but at the same time, have led to manifold problems including the problem of massive amount of hazardous waste and other waste generated from electric products. Such waste poses a serious threat to human health and environment. The issue of proper management of such hazardous E-Waste is therefore critical to the protection of livelihood, health and environment.
          </p>
          <p className="pd_ans">
            To deal with this ever-rising problem of E-Waste, the government of India, through its Ministry of Environment and forest, formulated the E-Waste (Management and Handling) Rules in 2016.
          </p>
          <div className="pd_q">ELENEXT INDIA PRIVATE LIMITED STANDS COMMITTED TO IMPLEMENT THE E-WASTE UNDER E-WASTE RULES.</div>
          <div className="pd_q">The Basel Convention defines wastes as-</div>
          <p className="pd_ans">
            “Substances or objects, which are disposed off or are intended to be disposed off, or are required to be disposed off by the provisions of national laws”.
          </p>
          <div className="pd_q">E waste has been defined as-</div>
          <p className="pd_ans">
            “Waste electrical and electronic equipment, whole or in part or rejects from their manufacturing and repair process, which are intended to be discarded.”
          </p>
          <p className="pd_ans">
            Whereas, Electrical and electronic equipment has been defined as:-
          </p>
          <p className="pd_ans">
            "Equipment which is dependent on electrical currents or electro-magnetic fields to fully functional".
          </p>
          <p className="pd_ans">
            Like hazardous waste, the problem of e-waste has become an immediate and long-term concern as its unregulated accumulation and recycling can lead to major environmental problems endangering human health. This calls for an urgent need for E-Waste Management so as to preserve the ecological balance and reduce landfills. Recycling end-of-life products is vital if we are to save resources and minimize waste. In this regard, we at Elenext India private limited have tied up with Reteck Envirotech Pvt. Ltd, one of the world’s largest authorized E-Waste recycler, for facilitating our Organization and our customers to enable them to dispose E-Waste products after its end-of-life.

          <div className="pd_q">Why Recycle.</div>
          <div className="pd_q">Conserve Resources</div>
          <p className="pd_ans">
            Creation requires raw resources. But when we recycle, extant material is put to use. Recycling saves this extraction of the fresh raw resources, and revives the existing ones that are no longer of use. This way there is lesser exploitation and more conservation of natural resources.
          </p>
          <div className="pd_q">Save Energy</div>
          <p className="pd_ans">
            Each time we recycle a product, it requires lesser energy than producing a new one from the scratch. The considerable difference in manufacturing time is a result of skipping the usual process of extraction of raw material, its transportation, refining etc., which is way more than having a market ready product that to have a raw material ready for production.
          </p>
          <div className="pd_q">Prevent Pollution</div>
          <p className="pd_ans">
            Production and disposal of products require a great deal of extraction, refining, processing and dumping of material, which have larger impact on the environment. By recycling, we cut down the pollution of air, water and land, thus reducing the greenhouse gas emission and avoiding any contribution to global warming.
