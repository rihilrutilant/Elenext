            In cases where a product accessory is found
            missing/damaged/defective, the seller may either process a
            replacement of the particular accessory or issue an eGV for an
            amount equivalent to the price of the accessory, at the seller’s
            discretion.

            During open box deliveries, while accepting your order, if you
            received a different or a damaged product, you will be given a
            refund (on the spot refunds for cash-on-delivery orders). Once you
            have accepted an open box delivery, no return request will be
            processed, except for manufacturing defects. In such cases, these
            category-specific replacement/return general conditions will be
            applicable. Click here to know more about Open Box Delivery
