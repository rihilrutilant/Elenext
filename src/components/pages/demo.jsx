                            It usually costs sellers more to ship some items.
                            So, sometimes they choose to add a delivery charge.
                            The delivery charge is waived off by some sellers if
                            you shop with them for a certain amount. For more
                            information, check the individual seller's policy on

                            The delivery charge is waived off by some sellers if

                            Product reviews on Elenext.com are a great way to
                            help other customers decide what to buy & avoid.

                            Here are some tips to writing great product reviews:
                            Have you used this product?It's always better to
                            review a product you have personally used. Educate
                            your readers.Provide a relevant, unbiased overview
                            of the product. Readers are interested in the pros
                            and the cons of the product. Make sure your review
                            stands the test of time, and what you write today is
                            relevant even after years. <br />
                            Be yourself, be informative. Let your personality
                            shine through, but it's equally important to provide
                            facts to back up your opinion. Get your facts right!
                            Nothing is worse than inaccurate information. If
                            you're not really sure, research always helps. Stay
                            concise.Be creative but also remember to stay on
                            topic. <br />A catchy title will always get
                            attention! Easy to read, easy on the eyes.A quick
                            edit & spell check will work wonders for your
                            credibility. Also, break reviews into small, easy
                            paragraphs.
